# StreamPack: RTMP and [SRT](https://github.com/Haivision/srt) live streaming SDK for Android

StreamPack is a modular live streaming library for Android made for both demanding video
broadcasters and new video enthusiasts.

It is designed to be used in live streaming and gaming apps.

## Setup

Get StreamPack core latest artifacts on mavenCentral:

```groovy
dependencies {
    implementation 'io.github.thibaultbee:streampack:2.5.2'
}
```

If you want to use RTMP, you need to add the following dependency:

```groovy
dependencies {
    implementation 'io.github.thibaultbee:streampack-extension-rtmp:2.5.2'
}
```

If you want to use SRT, you need to add the following dependency:

```groovy
dependencies {
    implementation 'io.github.thibaultbee:streampack-extension-srt:2.5.2'
}
```

If you use both RTMP and SRT, you might have a conflict with libssl.so and libcrypto.so because they
are both includes in native dependencies. To solve this, you can add in your `build.gradle`:

```groovy
android {
    packagingOptions {
        pickFirst '**/*.so'
    }
}
```

## Samples

### Camera and audio sample

For source code example on how to use camera and audio streamers, check
the [sample app directory](https://github.com/ThibaultBee/StreamPack/tree/master/demos/camera). On
first launch, you will have to set RTMP url or SRT server IP in the settings menu.

### Screen recorder

For source code example on how to use screen recorder streamer, check
the [sample screen recorder directory](https://github.com/ThibaultBee/StreamPack/tree/master/demos/screenrecorder)
. On first launch, you will have to set RTMP url or SRT server IP in the settings menu.

### Tests with a FFmpeg server

FFmpeg has been used as an SRT server+demuxer+decoder for the tests.

#### RTMP

Tells FFplay to listen on IP `0.0.0.0` and port `1935`.

```
ffplay -listen 1 -i rtmp://0.0.0.0:1935/s/streamKey
```

On StreamPack sample app settings, set `Endpoint` -> `Type` to `Stream to a remove RTMP device`,
then set the server `URL` to `rtmp://serverip:1935/s/streamKey`. At this point, StreamPack sample
app should successfully sends audio and video frames. On FFplay side, you should be able to watch
this live stream.

#### SRT

Check how to build FFmpeg with libsrt
in [SRT CookBook](https://srtlab.github.io/srt-cookbook/apps/ffmpeg/). Tells FFplay to listen on
IP `0.0.0.0` and port `9998`:

```
ffplay -fflags nobuffer srt://0.0.0.0:9998?mode=listener
```

On StreamPack sample app settings, set the server `IP` to your server IP and server `Port` to `9998`
. At this point, StreamPack sample app should successfully sends audio and video frames. On FFplay
side, you should be able to watch this live stream.

## Quick start

If you want to create a new application, you should use the
template [StreamPack boilerplate](https://github.com/ThibaultBee/StreamPack-boilerplate). In 5
minutes, you will be able to stream live video to your server.

1. Adds [permissions](#permissions) to your `AndroidManifest.xml` and request them in your
   Activity/Fragment.

2. Creates a `SurfaceView` to display camera preview in your layout

As a camera preview, you can use a `SurfaceView`, a `TextureView` or any
`View` where that can provide a `Surface`.

To simplify integration, StreamPack provides an `StreamerSurfaceView`.

```xml

<layout>
    <io.github.thibaultbee.streampack.views.StreamerSurfaceView 
        android:id="@+id/preview"
        android:layout_width="match_parent" 
        android:layout_height="match_parent"
        app:cameraFacingDirection="back"
        app:enableZoomOnPinch="true" />
</layout>
```

`app:cameraFacingDirection` can be `back` to start preview on the first back camera or `front` to
start preview on the first front camera.
`app:enableZoomOnPinch` is a boolean to enable zoom on pinch gesture.

3. Instantiates the streamer (main live streaming class)

```kotlin
val streamer = CameraSrtLiveStreamer(context = requireContext())
```

4. Configures

```kotlin
val audioConfig = AudioConfig(
    startBitrate = 128000,
    sampleRate = 44100,
    channelConfig = AudioFormat.CHANNEL_IN_STEREO
)

val videoConfig = VideoConfig(
    startBitrate = 2000000, // 2 Mb/s
    resolution = Size(1280, 720),
    fps = 30
)

streamer.configure(audioConfig, videoConfig)
```

5. Inflate the camera preview with the streamer

```kotlin
/**
 * preview: where to display preview. Its could be a SurfaceView, a TextureView,...
 */
preview.streamer = streamer
```

6. Starts the live streaming

```kotlin
streamer.startStream(ip, port)
```

7. Stops and releases

```kotlin
streamer.stopStream()
streamer.disconnect()
streamer.stopPreview() // The StreamerSurfaceView will be automatically stop the preview
streamer.release()
```

For more detailed explanation, check out
the [API documentation](https://thibaultbee.github.io/StreamPack).

## Permissions

You need to add the following permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml

<manifest>
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO" />
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA" />\
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />
    <!-- Application requires android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE only for IFileStreamer implementation` -->
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE" />
</manifest>
```

Your application also has to request the following dangerous
permission: `android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO`, `android.permission.CAMERA` and
`android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` (only for only for `IFileStreamer` implementation).

For the PlayStore, your application might declare this in its `AndroidManifest.xml`

```xml

<manifest>
    <uses-feature android:name="android.hardware.camera" android:required="true" />
    <uses-feature android:name="android.hardware.camera.autofocus" android:required="false" />
</manifest>
```

## Tips

### RTMP or SRT

RTMP and SRT are both live streaming protocols. SRT is a UDP-based modern protocol, it is reliable
and ultra low latency. RTMP is a TCP-based protocol, it is also reliable but it is only low latency.
There are already a lot of comparison over the Internet, so here is a summary:
SRT:

- Ultra low latency (< 1s)
- HEVC support through MPEG-TS RTMP:
- Low latency (2-3s)
- HEVC not officially support (specification has been aban by its creator)

So, the main question is: "which protocol to use?"
It is easy: if your server has SRT support, use SRT otherwise use RTMP.

### Streamers

Let's start with some definitions! `Streamers` are classes that represent a live streaming pipeline:
capture, encode, mux and send. They comes in multiple flavours: with different audio and video
source, with different endpoints and functionalities... 3 types of base streamers are available:

- `CameraStreamers`: for streaming from camera
- `ScreenRecorderStreamers`: for streaming from screen
- `AudioOnlyStreamers`: for streaming audio only

You can find specific streamers for File or for Live. Currently, there are 2 main endpoints:

- `FileStreamer`: for streaming to file
- `LiveStreamer`: for streaming to a RTMP or a SRT live streaming server

For example, you can use `AudioOnlyFlvFileStreamer` to stream from microphone only to a FLV file.
Another example, you can use `CameraRtmpLiveStreamer` to stream from camera to a RTMP server.

If a streamer is missing, of course, you can also create your own. You should definitely submit it
in a [pull request](https://github.com/ThibaultBee/StreamPack/pulls).

### Get device capabilities

Have you ever wonder: "What are the supported resolution of my cameras?" or "What is the supported
sample rate of my audio codecs?"? `Helpers` classes are made for this. All `Streamer` comes with a
specific `Helper` object (I am starting to have the feeling I repeat myself):

```kotlin
val helper = streamer.helper
```

### Get extended settings

If you are looking for more settings on streamer, like the exposure compensation of your camera, you
must have a look on `Settings` class. All together: "All `Streamer` comes with a specific `Settings`
object":

```kotlin
streamer.settings
```

For example, if you want to change the exposure compensation of your camera, on a `CameraStreamers`
you can do it like this:

```kotlin
streamer.settings.camera.exposure.compensation = value
```

Moreover you can check exposure range and step with:

```kotlin
streamer.settings.camera.exposure.availableCompensationRange
streamer.settings.camera.exposure.availableCompensationStep
```

### Screen recorder Service

To record the screen, you have to use one of the `ScreenRecorderStreamers` inside
an [Android Service](https://developer.android.com/guide/components/services). To simplify this
integration, StreamPack provides several `ScreenRecorderService` classes. Extends one of these class
and overrides `onNotification` to customise the notification.

### Android SDK version

Even if StreamPack sdk supports a `minSdkVersion` 21. I strongly recommend to set the
`minSdkVersion` of your application to a higher version (the highest is the best!) for higher
performance.
