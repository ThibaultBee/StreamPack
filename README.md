# StreamPack: live streaming SDK based on Secure Reliable Transport ([SRT](https://github.com/Haivision/srt)) 

**/!\\/!\WARNING: StreamPack is a Work In Progress/!\\/!\\**

Brings the best audio/video live technologies together in order to achieve low-latency & high quality
live streaming on Android.

## Setup

Get StreamPack latest artifacts on [jitpack.io](https://jitpack.io/#ThibaultBee/StreamPack)

```gradle
allprojects {
    repositories {
        ...
        maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
    }
}

dependencies {
    implementation 'com.github.ThibaultBee:StreamPack:0.8.0'
}
```

## Sample

For source code example, check the [sample app directory](https://github.com/ThibaultBee/StreamPack/tree/master/app).
On first launch, you will have to set SRT server IP in the settings menu.

### Quick start with a FFmpeg SRT server

FFmpeg has been used as an SRT server+demuxer+decoder for the tests. Check how to build FFmpeg with 
libsrt in [SRT CookBook](https://srtlab.github.io/srt-cookbook/apps/ffmpeg/).
Tells FFplay to listen on IP `0.0.0.0` and port `9998`:

```
ffplay -fflags nobuffer srt://0.0.0.0:9998?mode=listener
```

On StreamPack sample app settings, set the server `IP` to your server IP and server `port` to `9998`.
At this point, StreamPack sample app should successfully sends audio and video frames. On FFplay 
side, you should be able to watch this stream.

## API

Captures your camera and microphone frames. Streams them to a SRT server. It is that simple:

```
// Prepare A/V configurations
val audioConfig = AudioConfig.Builder()
                      .setStartBitrate(128000)
                      .setSampleRate(48000)
                      .setNumberOfChannel(2)
                      .build()

val videoConfig = VideoConfig.Builder()
                    .setStartBitrate(1000000) // 1 Mb/s
                    .setResolution(Size(1280,720))
                    .setFps(30)
                    .build()

val streamer = CameraTsFileStreamer.Builder()
                .setContext(getApplication())
                .setServiceInfo(tsServiceInfo)
                .setConfiguration(audioConfig, videoConfig)
                .build()
...
// where to display preview
streamer.startPreview(surface)
...
// Connect to a SRT server
streamer.connect(ip, port)
...
streamer.startStream()
...
// Stops and cleans stream
streamer.stopStream()
...
streamer.disconnect()
...
streamer.stopPreview()
...
streamer.release()
```

For more detailed explanation, check out the [API documentation](https://thibaultbee.github.io/StreamPack/dokka/sdk).

## Permissions

You need to add the following permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO" />
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA" />
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />
<!-- Application requires android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE only if you use `CaptureFileStream` -->
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE" />
```

Your application also has to request the following dangerous permission: `android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO`, `android.permission.CAMERA` and 
`android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` (only for `CaptureFileStream`).

For the PlayStore, your application might declare in its `AndroidManifest.xml`

```
<uses-feature android:name="android.hardware.camera" android:required="true" />
<uses-feature android:name="android.hardware.camera.autofocus" android:required="false" />
```

## Android SDK version

Even if StreamPack sdk supports a `minSdkVersion` 21. I strongly recommend to set the
`minSdkVersion` of your application to a higher version (the highest is the best!).
