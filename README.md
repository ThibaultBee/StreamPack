## Quick start

If you want to create a new application, you should use the
template [StreamPack boilerplate](https://github.com/ThibaultBee/StreamPack-boilerplate). In 5
minutes, you will be able to stream live video to your server.

## Getting started

### Getting started for a camera stream

1. Request the required permissions in your Activity/Fragment. See the
   [Permissions](#permissions) section for more information.

2. Creates a `View` to display the preview in your layout

   As a camera preview, you can also use a `SurfaceView`, a `TextureView` or any
   `View` where that can provide a `Surface`.

   To simplify integration, StreamPack provides an `PreviewView` in the `streampack-ui` package.

    ```xml
    
    <layout>
        <io.github.thibaultbee.streampack.views.PreviewView android:id="@+id/preview"
            android:layout_width="match_parent" android:layout_height="match_parent"
            app:enableZoomOnPinch="true" />
    </layout>
    ```

   `app:enableZoomOnPinch` is a boolean to enable zoom on pinch gesture.

3. Instantiates the streamer (main live streaming class)

   A `Streamer` is a class that represents a whole streaming pipeline from capture to endpoint (
   incl. encoding, muxing, sending).
   Multiple streamers are available depending on the number of independent outputs you want to
   have:
    - `SingleStreamer`: for a single output (live or record)
    - `DualStreamer`: for 2 independent outputs (live and record/record audio in file and video
      in
      another file)
    - for multiple outputs, you can use the `StreamerPipeline` class that allows to create a
      custom pipeline with multiple independent outputs.

   The `SingleStreamer` and the `DualStreamer` comes with factory for `Camera` and
   `ScreenRecorder`.
   Otherwise, you can set the audio and the video source manually.

    ```kotlin
    /**
     * Most StreamPack components are coroutine based.
     * Suspend and flow have to be called from a coroutine scope.
     * Android comes with coroutine scopes like `lifecycleScope` or `viewModelScope`.
     * Call suspend functions from a coroutine scope:
     *  viewModelScope.launch {
     *  }
     */
    val streamer = CameraSingleStreamer(context = requireContext())
    // To have multiple independent outputs (like for live and record), use a `CameraDualStreamer` or even the `StreamerPipeline`.
    // You can also use the `SingleStreamer`or the `DualStreamer` and add later the audio and video source with `setAudioSource` 
    // and `setVideoSource`.
    ```

   For more information, check the [Streamers](docs/Streamers.md) documentation.

4. Configures audio and video settings

    ```kotlin
    val streamer = CameraSingleStreamer(context = requireContext()) // Already instantiated streamer
    
    // Creates a new audio and video config
    val audioConfig = AudioCodecConfig(
        startBitrate = 128000,
        sampleRate = 44100,
        channelConfig = AudioFormat.CHANNEL_IN_STEREO
    )
    
    val videoConfig = VideoCodecConfig(
        startBitrate = 2000000, // 2 Mb/s
        resolution = Size(1280, 720),
        fps = 30
    )
    
    // Sets the audio and video config
    viewModelScope.launch {
        streamer.setAudioConfig(audioConfig)
        streamer.setVideoConfig(videoConfig)
    }
    ```

5. Inflates the preview with the streamer

    ```kotlin
    val streamer = CameraSingleStreamer(context = requireContext()) // Already instantiated streamer
    val preview = findViewById<PreviewView>(R.id.preview) // Already inflated preview
    /**
     * If the preview is a `PreviewView`
     */
    preview.streamer = streamer
    // Then start the preview
    streamer.startPreview()
    
    /**
     * Otherwise if the preview is in a [SurfaceView], a [TextureView], a [Surface],... you can use:
     */
    streamer.startPreview(preview)
    ```

6. Sets the device orientation

    ```kotlin
    // Already instantiated streamer
    val streamer = CameraSingleStreamer(context = requireContext())
    
    // Sets the device orientation
    streamer.setTargetRotation(Surface.ROTATION_90) // Or Surface.ROTATION_0, Surface.ROTATION_180, Surface.ROTATION_270
    ```

   StreamPack comes with 2 `RotationProvider` that fetches and listens the device rotation:

    - the `SensorRotationProvider`. The `SensorRotationProvider` is backed by the
      `OrientationEventListener` and it follows the device orientation.
    - the `DisplayRotationProvider`. The `DisplayRotationProvider` is backed by the `DisplayManager`
      and if orientation is locked, it will return the last known orientation.

    ```kotlin
    val streamer = CameraSingleStreamer(context = requireContext()) // Already instantiated streamer
    val rotationProvider = SensorRotationProvider(context = requireContext())
    
    // Sets the device orientation
   rotationProvider.addListener(object : IRotationProvider.Listener {
        override fun onOrientationChanged(rotation: Int) {
            streamer.setTargetRotation(rotation)
        }
    })

    // Don't forget to remove the listener when you don't need it anymore
    rotationProvider.removeListener(listener)
    ```

   You can transform the `RotationProvider` into a `Flow` provider through the `asFlowProvider`.

   ```kotlin
    val streamer = CameraSingleStreamer(context = requireContext()) // Already instantiated streamer
    val rotationProvider = SensorRotationProvider(context = requireContext())
   
    // For coroutine based
    val rotationFlowProvider = rotationProvider.asFlowProvider()
    // Then in a coroutine suspend function
    rotationFlowProvider.rotationFlow.collect { rotation ->
    streamer.setTargetRotation(rotation)
    }
    ```

   You can also create your own `targetRotation` provider.

7. Starts the live streaming

    ```kotlin
    // Already instantiated streamer
    val streamer = CameraSingleStreamer(context = requireContext())
    
    val descriptor =
        UriMediaDescriptor("rtmps://serverip:1935/s/streamKey") // For RTMP/RTMPS. Uri also supports SRT url, file path, content path,...
    /**
     * Alternatively, you can use object syntax:
     * - RtmpMediaDescriptor("rtmps", "serverip", 1935, "s", "streamKey") // For RTMP/RTMPS
     * - SrtMediaDescriptor("serverip", 1234) // For SRT
     */
    
    streamer.startStream(descriptor) 
    // You can also use:
    // streamer.startStream("rtmp://serverip:1935/s/streamKey") // For RTMP/RTMPS
    ```

8. Stops and releases the streamer

    ```kotlin
    // Already instantiated streamer
    val streamer = CameraSingleStreamer(context = requireContext())
    
    streamer.stopStream()
    streamer.close() // Disconnect from server or close the file
    streamer.release()
    ```

For more detailed explanation, check out
the [documentation](#documentations).

For a complete example, check out the [demos/camera](demos/camera) directory.

### Getting started for a screen recorder stream

1. Add the `streampack-services` dependency in your `build.gradle` file:

    ```groovy
    dependencies {
        implementation 'io.github.thibaultbee.streampack:streampack-services:3.0.0'
    }
    ```

2. Requests the required permissions in your Activity/Fragment. See the
   [Permissions](#permissions) section for more information.
3. Creates a `MyService` that extends `DefaultScreenRecorderService` (so you can customize
   notifications among other things).
4. Creates a screen record `Intent` and requests the activity result

    ```kotlin
    ScreenRecorderSingleStreamer.createScreenRecorderIntent(context = requireContext())
    ```

4. Starts the service

    ```kotlin
    DefaultScreenRecorderService.launch(
        requireContext(),
        MyService::class.java,
        { streamer ->
            streamer.setActivityResult(result)
            try {
                configure(streamer)
            } catch (t: Throwable) {
                // Handle exception
            }
            startStream(streamer)
        }
    )
    ```

For a complete example, check out the [demos/screenrecorder](demos/screenrecorder) directory .

## Permissions

You need to add the following permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml

<manifest>
    <!-- Only for a live -->
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />
    <!-- Only for a local record -->
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE" />
</manifest>
```

To record locally, you also need to request the following dangerous
permission: `android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE`.

### Permissions for a camera stream

To use the camera, you need to request the following permission:

```xml

<manifest>
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO" />
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA" />
</manifest>
```

Your application also has to request the following dangerous
permission: `android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO`, `android.permission.CAMERA`.

For the PlayStore, your application might declare this in its `AndroidManifest.xml`

```xml

<manifest>
    <uses-feature android:name="android.hardware.camera" android:required="true" />
    <uses-feature android:name="android.hardware.camera.autofocus" android:required="false" />
</manifest>
```

### Permissions for a screen recorder stream

To use the screen recorder, you need to request the following permission:

```xml

<manifest>
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.FOREGROUND_SERVICE_MEDIA_PROJECTION" />
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.FOREGROUND_SERVICE" />
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.POST_NOTIFICATIONS" />
    <!-- Only if you have to record audio -->
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO" />
</manifest>
```

You will also have to declare the `Service`,

```xml

<application>
    <!-- YourScreenRecorderService extends DefaultScreenRecorderService -->
    <service android:name=".services.YourScreenRecorderService" android:exported="false"
        android:foregroundServiceType="mediaProjection" />
</application>
```

    - [Streamer elements](docs/AdvancedStreamer)

## Demos

### Camera and audio demo

For source code example on how to use camera and audio streamers,
check [demos/camera](demos/camera). On
first launch, you will have to set RTMP url or SRT server IP in the settings menu.

### Screen recorder demo

For source code example on how to use screen recorder streamer, check
the [demos/screenrecorder](demos/screenrecorder)
. On first launch, you will have to set RTMP url or SRT server IP in the settings menu.

### Tests with a FFmpeg server

FFmpeg has been used as an SRT server+demuxer+decoder for the tests.

#### RTMP

Tells FFplay to listen on IP `0.0.0.0` and port `1935`.

```
ffplay -listen 1 -i 'rtmp://0.0.0.0:1935/s/streamKey'
```

On StreamPack sample app settings, set `Endpoint` -> `Type` to `Stream to a remove RTMP device`,
then set the server `URL` to `rtmp://serverip:1935/s/streamKey`. At this point, StreamPack sample
app should successfully sends audio and video frames. On FFplay side, you should be able to watch
this live stream.

#### SRT

Tells FFplay to listen on IP `0.0.0.0` and port `9998`:

```
ffplay -fflags nobuffer 'srt://0.0.0.0:9998?mode=listener'
```

On StreamPack sample app settings, set the server `IP` to your server IP and server `Port` to`9998`.
At this point, StreamPack sample app should successfully sends audio and video frames. On FFplay
side, you should be able to watch this live stream.

## Tips

### RTMP or SRT

RTMP and SRT are both live streaming protocols. SRT is a UDP-based modern protocol, it is
reliable and ultra low latency. RTMP is a TCP-based protocol, it is also reliable but it is only low
latency.
There are already a lot of comparison over the Internet, so here is a summary:

* SRT:
    - Ultra low latency(< 1 s)
* RTMP:
    - Low latency (2 - 3 s)

So, the main question is : "which protocol to use?"
It is easy: if your server has SRT support, use SRT otherwise use RTMP.

### Get device and protocol capabilities

Have you ever wonder : "What are the supported resolution of my cameras?" or "What is the supported
sample rate of my audio codecs ?"? `Info` classes are made for this. All `Streamer` comes with a
specific `Info` object:

 ```kotlin
val info = streamer.getInfo(MediaDescriptor("rtmps://serverip:1935/s/streamKey"))
```

For static endpoint or an opened dynamic endpoint, you can directly get the info:

```kotlin
val info = streamer.info
```

### Element specific configuration

If you are looking for more settings on streamer, like the exposure compensation of your camera, you
must have a look on `Settings` class. Each `Streamer` elements (such as `IVideoSource`,
`IAudioSource`,...)
comes with a public interface that allows to have access to specific information or configuration.

Example: if the video source can be cast to `ICameraSource` interface. You get the access to
`settings`
that allows to get and set the current camera settings:

```kotlin
(streamer.videoSource as ICameraSource).settings
```

Example: you can change the exposure compensation of your camera, on a `CameraStreamers`
you can do it like this:

```kotlin
(streamer.videoSource as ICameraSource).settings.exposure.compensation = value
```

Moreover you can retrieve exposure range and step with:

```kotlin
(streamer.videoSource as ICameraSource).settings.exposure.availableCompensationRange
(streamer.videoSource as ICameraSource).settings.exposure.availableCompensationStep
```

See the [docs/AdvancedStreamer.md](docs/AdvancedStreamer#element-specific-configuration) for more
information.

### Android versions

Even if StreamPack sdk supports a `minSdkVersion` 21. I strongly recommend to set the
`minSdkVersion` of your application to a higher version (the highest is the best!) for better
performance.
