Version 3.0.0-RC
-------------

Version 3.0.0-RC is a release candidate for the next major version of StreamPack. It includes:

- dynamic endpoint: the endpoint (RTMP, SRT, File,...) is inferred from the stream URL.
- multiple outputs: you can now stream to multiple endpoints at the same time.
- dynamic input: you can set the input source (camera, screen, file,...) at runtime.
- a new file writer based on Android `MediaMuxer`.
- package have been moved, renamed and splits.

For the migration, see
the [migration guide](https://github.com/ThibaultBee/StreamPack/wiki/Migration-from-2.6.X-to-3.X.X).

- VideoConfig: only set HDR when profile and level can be set

Version 2.6.0
-------------

## API Changes:

- `startStream` and `stopStream` are now a suspend methods because they triggers a network
  operation. Therefore they must be called from a coroutine.

## Features:

- Camera streamer: mirror the video on the stream when the front camera is used. Preview is not
  mirrored.
- RTMP: Add support for enhanced RTMP video codecs (HEVC, VP9 and AV1 (experimental,
  see https://github.com/ThibaultBee/StreamPack/discussions/90))
- RTMP: Improve synchronization on audio and video frames: force to send Header 0 when timestamp are
  not in order.
- HDR: Add experimental support for HDR camera streamers,
  see https://github.com/ThibaultBee/StreamPack/discussions/91
- VideoConfig: infer the bitrate from the resolution when it is not explicitly set.
- SRT: add a latency setting.
- SRT and RTMP: add specific class to describe the connection (see `SrtConnectionDescriptor`
  and `RtmpConnectionDescriptor`).
- AAC: add support for multiple AAC profiles (HE-AAC, HE-AACv2, ...).
- ISO Sensitivity: Add an API to set ISO sensitivity for camera streamers.
- MP4: Introduce MP4 muxer and new MP4 streamers. (Fragmented MP4)
- Screen recorder: display root cause on notification instead of the exception message.
- Codec helper: get only once instance of each profiles.
- Camera: add an API to set `onTap` for auto exposure, auto focus and auto white balance
  independently.
- Improve orientation management.
- Upgrade to Android 14, gradle 8 and Kotlin 1.9
- Internal: rename `Capture` to `Source`

## Bug fixes:

- Camera: fix default camera when device does not have a "0" camera
- Camera: fix an `onTap` crash when the device zoom ratio is < 1
- Camera: fix auto focus trigger on tap
